# Sort-Desktop
A small console app in python that will help me keep my desktop clean.
Keep in mind that for whatever reason it might work weird when ran in IDLE, I suggest running by double click or trough cmd.

If someone by any chance comes across this app and has things to say:

This app is probably not good for everyone. Feel free to suggest improvements. If this sorting mechanism doesn't fit you, well, it's your problem. There is no UI. I'll add features only if I need them.
